        You will be given an on-line speaking test in which you will record your responses to specific questions. 
        Questions will consist of two parts. The first part, describing a situation, is both written and recorded. 
        The second part is an audio prompt. Your recorded answers will be sent to your instructor or an outside 
        evaluator for analysis. You may receive some basic feedback on your language skill.

        <br> <br>
        There will be several pages of instruction to the oral test. You may complete the oral test at your leisure, 
        taking all the time you need and responding as completely as you can. Please answer each question verbally 
        by speaking clearly into the microphone. Your oral response will be sent to the server.

        <br> <br>
        Your responses will be kept on our server for the evaluation and will also be available to you when receiving 
        the feedback.

        <br> <br>
        All data on the server is kept confidential.

        <br> <br>
        You may request deletion of your file from the server by sending a request to larclabs@gmail.com
        In a post-test questionnaire, we will ask information about your language background and your experiences 
        using the language. This information will help in our rater training. If you are concerned about this data 
        being retained, simply skip the questionnaire when finishing the test.
